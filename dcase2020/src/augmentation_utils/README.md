# augmentation_utils
A personnal repository to store all the augmentation I work with.

This is a repository for my personnal usage and you can use as it comes.

It contains augmentation for images, spectrogram and audio signal. I can process single file or whole mini-batch. It can be used on numpy array or directly tensor (convert them into numpy array and then back into tensor)
